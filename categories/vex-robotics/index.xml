&lt;p>While it comes, the application seasion, full of tension, sadness and happiness. At this time, just after finsihing submitting all UC applications, I decided to join this competiton held in Foshan, Guangdong, which is a prosperous city around the Guangzhou. It is a short break for me, for I have some time to reflect the early application season including EA and UC and better think how could I improve in the future. Also, I haven&amp;rsquo;t taken any VEX competition for almost a year due to the COVID. It is the best time for me to catch up with this brand new season and implement my new-learned knowledge in real match.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today we officially began our new season robotics development. To be honest, I have less time available this season due to my SAT and TOEFL exam and college application stuff. However, I want to insist on this activity which I&amp;rsquo;ve already participated since my middle school. My job will gravitate mainly on programming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, we move to a brand new activity room with double area and completely new equipment and match field. Hope I can achieve some accomplishments that I left as pities last season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So sad that today I am alone in my team. They are all busy preparing AP makeup exams, although I also need to retake.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now I am on the bullet train from Xi’an to Baoding, crossing one tunnel after another, passing one bridge after another. Just a few minutes ago, I was sleeping deeply, but now I think I am conscious.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="sleepless-night" class="relative group">Sleepless night &lt;/h2>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>From the beginning of the summer vacation, I was studying TOEFL everyday following a regular routine – getting up at 7AM, doing TOEFL practice all the day and then going to bed at 11PM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Last night even didn’t close my eyes for a while because of the unfinished autonomous program. It’s a hard and harsh work putting tons of parameters and variables to my mind simultaneously. Fortunately, with my team members Tony and Jessica helping me reset the match field quickly and accurately, finally I got it. Never forget the colorful cubes leaps on the match field which seem to lose control.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="nervous-time" class="relative group">Nervous time &lt;/h2>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>To be honest, I didn’t put too many efforts in the VEX competition these summer vacation. I just came to participate in training two days before our setting off. I am really awkward to my excellent team member and coach Mr. Han.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The robot that will be used in the competition hadn’t been finished two days before. Our manipulator Tony hadn’t practice controlling the robot like catching the cube and pile them up in the specific area which is not easy and definitely needs time to be familiar with the way of controlling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily, we had done everything in time under the unity of our team which is the most valuable and precious thing I got from the robot club. I saw everyone mounting screw carefully, writing engineer log amazingly… There exists many good personalities and characters that I need to learn from them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My article was published in the school newspaper!</title><link>/posts/2019-04-29-my-article-was-published-in-the-school-newspaper.md/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2019 16:43:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2019-04-29-my-article-was-published-in-the-school-newspaper.md/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="summary-of-2019-vex-worlds-championship" class="relative group">Summary of 2019 VEX Worlds Championship &lt;/h1>

&lt;p>难忘的一次经历。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="久别重逢" class="relative group">久别重逢 &lt;/h2>
&lt;p>作为刚刚转入国际班的新生，我很荣幸被韩老师选中参加VEX2019世锦赛。赛前，有激动、欣喜，也有紧张与茫然。VEX，于我而言是一个既熟悉又陌生的竞赛项目。初中时在韩老师的带领下参加了“一网打尽”和“星光璀璨”两个赛季，也收获了很多。本以为与VEX在此分道扬镳，没想到如今的久别重逢。与熟悉的金属结构件相遇、与机器人对抗电机高速旋转的齿轮声相遇，更重要的，更重要的是与初中时有着共同热爱与梦想的同学们和老师重逢。这一切都让我激动不已，就像是星星之火在无数个暴风雪夜之后重新成为熊熊烈火一样，照亮了我的心。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>当然，新的问题接踵而至。VEX推出了全新的V5主控套装，新的编程环境，这一切都是需要我去学习和尽快掌握新的知识；这里有了更多陌生的面孔，有身经百战的学姐和学长、还有已经征战将近一个赛季的国一的同学们。而我，作为一个新加入机器人社团大家庭的人，如何让大家认识我、了解我、信任我是亟待解决的问题。&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Summary of 2019 VEX Robotics World Championship</title><link>/posts/2019-04-29-summary-of-2019-vex-robotics-world-championship.md/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2019 00:51:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2019-04-29-summary-of-2019-vex-robotics-world-championship.md/</guid><description>VEX 2019世锦赛总结 难忘的一次经历。</description></item></channel></rss>
